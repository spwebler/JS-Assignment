There are 8 basic data types in JavaScript.

number      for numbers of any kind: integer or floating-point, integers are limited by ±253.
bigint       is for integer numbers of arbitrary length.
string      for strings. A string may have zero or more characters, there’s no separate single-character type.
boolean     for true/false.
null        for unknown values – a standalone type that has a single value null.
undefined   for unassigned values – a standalone type that has a single value undefined.
object      for more complex data structures.
symbol      for unique identifiers.
